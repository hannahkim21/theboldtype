CS 170 Fall 2019 Project

Hello! Welcome to our project.

To run the project: use the command python3 solver.py in your terminal.
The arguments should be:
1) --all in order to run it on all of the input files
2) the file path to your input directory
3) the file path to your output directory
4) params, which we did not use, but would specify additional arguments

We used the Python package networkx, which is a graph package which we used to generate our inputs and for our solver method.
